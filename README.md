# AI_algorithms

This project is trying to explore basic and AI algorithms, so there are some folders, "basic alg" and "AI alg", etc.

## basic algorithms
This is based on LeeCode problems, focus on easy and medium problems, and some hard problems.
Why? because they are fundamental knowledge and will be used a lot in AI projects.
Of course, Python provide lots of libraries to help you on AI projects. 
It is better to know the logic before using.

### Array algorithms

### Linked list algorithms

### Strings algorithms

### Tree search and node algorithms

### graph and dfs, bfs algorithms
    Please see https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/
    

## AI algorithms
